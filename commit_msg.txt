upgrade: postgres 18, clickhouse 25.11 ready (v0.10.0)

Infrastructure upgrades:
- PostgreSQL: 17-alpine -> 18.1-alpine3.23 (both app + users DBs)
- ClickHouse: 24-alpine -> 25.11.2.24-alpine (latest Alpine image)
- Docker images built and pushed successfully

IMPORTANT: PostgreSQL 18 requires data migration
- Major version upgrade changes data directory format
- Containers cannot start with existing v17 data
- Manual migration needed before deployment:
  1. Stop containers
  2. Backup /mnt/user/appdata/lynxprompt/postgres-* 
  3. Either: Fresh start (remove volumes) OR use pg_upgrade/pg_dump
  4. Redeploy with new images

Prisma v7 attempted but reverted - TypeScript-only output incompatible with Next.js Turbopack build system.
