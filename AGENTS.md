- Keep functions focused and testable

## ⚠️ Security Notice

> **Do not commit secrets to the repository or to the live app.**
> Always use secure standards to transmit sensitive information.
> Use environment variables, secret managers, or secure vaults for credentials.

**🔍 Security Audit Recommendation:** When making changes that involve authentication, data handling, API endpoints, or dependencies, proactively offer to perform a security review of the affected code.
