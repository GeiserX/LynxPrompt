## 🔴 Planned Features

### Core Functionality

#### Wizard Improvements

- [x] Generate configuration files from wizard choices
- [x] Download as ZIP with all selected files
- [x] Copy individual files to clipboard
- [x] Preview generated content before download
- [ ] Save wizard configurations as drafts
- [ ] Import existing configs (upload `.cursor/rules/` or `AGENTS.md` to create template)

#### Wizard 2.0: Six Core Areas

Based on [GitHub's analysis of 2,500+ agents.md files](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-write-a-great-agents-md-lessons-from-over-2500-repositories/), effective AI configs need six core areas. The wizard should generate all of these:

| Area | Description | Wizard Step |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **1. Persona** | Who the AI is and what it specializes in | 🆕 New step |
| **2. Commands** | Executable build/test/lint commands | CI/CD step (expand) |
| **3. Project Structure** | Tech stack, file organization | Tech Stack step ✅ |
| **4. Code Style** | Naming conventions, examples of good/bad code | 🆕 New step |
| **5. Git Workflow** | Branching, commits, PR conventions | Repository step ✅ |
| **6. Boundaries** | Always do / Ask first / Never do | 🆕 New step |

**New Wizard Steps (Planned):**

- [ ] **Persona Step**: Define the AI's role and expertise
  - Role selection: Code reviewer, Test writer, Docs generator, API builder, etc.
  - Specialization: Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Security, etc.
  - Output style: Verbose, concise, educational

- [ ] **Commands Step**: Define executable commands
  - Build command (e.g., `npm run build`, `cargo build`)
  - Test command (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest -v`)
  - Lint command (e.g., `npm run lint --fix`, `ruff check`)
  - Dev server command (e.g., `npm run dev`)
  - Auto-detect from `package.json`, `Makefile`, `Cargo.toml`

- [ ] **Code Style Step**: Define coding standards
  - Naming conventions (functions, classes, constants)
  - Good/bad code examples (auto-generated from language selection)
  - Import ordering preferences
  - Error handling patterns

- [ ] **Boundaries Step**: Define AI guardrails
  - **Always**: Files/folders it can freely modify
  - **Ask First**: Actions requiring user approval (schema changes, new deps)
  - **Never**: Files to never touch, actions to never take
  - Common presets: "Conservative", "Standard", "Permissive"

**YAML Frontmatter Support:**

- [ ] Generate YAML frontmatter for named agents
  - `name`: Agent identifier (e.g., `test-agent`, `docs-agent`)
  - `description`: One-sentence purpose
  - Support for custom agents: `@test-agent`, `@docs-agent`, `@lint-agent`

**Agent Presets:**

Based on GitHub's recommended agents, offer one-click presets:

| Preset | Description | Commands | Boundaries |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| `@docs-agent` | Generates documentation | `npm run docs:build`, `markdownlint` | Write to `docs/`, never modify source |
| `@test-agent` | Writes tests | `npm test`, `pytest -v` | Write to `tests/`, never remove failing tests |
| `@lint-agent` | Fixes code style | `npm run lint --fix`, `prettier` | Only fix style, never change logic |
| `@api-agent` | Builds API endpoints | `npm run dev`, `curl` tests | Modify routes, ask before schema changes |
| `@deploy-agent` | Handles dev deployments | `npm run build`, `docker build` | Only deploy to dev, require approval |

#### Wizard Tiers (Feature Gating) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

| Feature                                | Free | Pro | Max |

- [ ] Device/location tracking for 2FA decisions
- [ ] Session management (view and revoke active sessions)

### Template Sharing & Selling

#### Who Can Share Templates

- Free users: Can share free templates only
- Pro/Max users: Can share both free and paid templates

#### Template Upload Options

1. **Direct Upload**: Write/paste prompt content, add title, tags, description
2. **From Wizard**: Save wizard-generated config as a shareable template
3. **Import**: Upload existing config files to create template

#### Pricing Options for Authors

- Free template (no cost to download)
- Paid template (min €5, author sets price)
- "Included in Max" option (earns from subscription pool)
- "Purchase only" option (not included in Max pool)

### Naming Convention

> **Note:** "Templates" have been renamed to **"Agent Blueprints"** throughout the application to better align with the AGENTS.md standard and convey a more premium, structured approach to AI configuration files. The term "blueprints" suggests reusable architectural patterns rather than simple templates.

### Blueprint System (formerly Template System)

#### Composable Template Sections (Template Mixing)

Enable users to build custom configurations by cherry-picking sections from multiple templates:

- [ ] **Section-based template structure**: Templates divided into logical sections (deployment, commit rules, PR rules, code style, testing, security, etc.)
- [ ] **Multi-template selector**: When downloading, select which sections to include from each template
- [ ] **Default behavior**: "Select All" from a single template, with option to mix
- [ ] **Section preview**: Preview each section before adding to final config
- [ ] **Section compatibility**: Detect and warn about conflicting sections
- [ ] **Favorite sections**: Save preferred sections for quick reuse
- [ ] **Section attribution**: Track which sections came from which authors
- [ ] **Custom section ordering**: Drag-and-drop to arrange sections in final output
- [ ] **Section categories**: Standardized taxonomy (Deployment, Git Workflow, Code Style, Testing, Security, Documentation, AI Behavior, etc.)

**Example workflow:**
1. User finds Template A with great deployment rules
2. User finds Template B with perfect commit conventions  
3. User finds Template C with ideal PR guidelines
4. User selects: Deployment → Template A, Commit Rules → Template B, PR Rules → Template C
5. LynxPrompt generates a merged configuration file with all selected sections

**Implementation approach (no AI required):**
- Templates use standardized markdown headers (e.g., `## Deployment`, `## Commit Rules`, `## PR Guidelines`)
- Parser splits templates into sections based on H2 headers
- Users tag their templates with section categories during upload
- System merges selected sections programmatically, handling conflicts via user selection
- Similar to how AGENTS.md works: structured markdown that any tool can parse

#### Template Variables System

Enable dynamic values in templates that users fill in when downloading:

**Delimiter**: `[[variable_name]]` 
- Chosen because `{{}}` conflicts with Vue, Angular, Handlebars, Jinja2, etc.
- `[[]]` is distinctive and rarely used in code
- Escape literal brackets with `\[\[` if needed

**Features**:
- [ ] **Variable detection**: Auto-detect `[[...]]` patterns in template content
- [ ] **Download-time prompts**: When downloading, prompt user to fill in detected variables
- [ ] **Variable highlighting**: Show variables highlighted in code preview (different color/background)
- [ ] **Recent values storage**: Store last-used values per variable name in user preferences
  - Stored in `Preference` table with category `"variables"`
  - Treat sensitively (may contain API keys, URLs, cluster names)
  - Allow user to clear stored values
- [ ] **Wizard variable support**: Templates created via wizard can include variables
- [ ] **Upload emphasis**: When uploading templates, emphasize use of variables for customization
- [ ] **Common variable suggestions**: Suggest common variable names (e.g., `[[CONFLUENCE_URL]]`, `[[K8S_CLUSTER]]`, `[[PROJECT_NAME]]`)

**Example**:
```markdown
## Deployment
Deploy to [[K8S_CLUSTER]] cluster using Helm.
Documentation at [[CONFLUENCE_URL]]/deployment-guide
```

When downloading, user sees:
- "K8S_CLUSTER" → input field (suggested: previously used value)
- "CONFLUENCE_URL" → input field (suggested: previously used value)

#### Template Management

- [x] **Template versioning** ✅ (version history with changelogs, published vs draft)
- [ ] Template forking (duplicate & customize others' templates)
- [x] Template preview (show what files look like before download) ✅
- [ ] Template ratings and reviews
- [ ] Featured templates section

#### Search & Discovery

- [x] Basic search by name/description/tags
- [x] Sort by popularity, date, downloads, favorites
- [x] Platform filters with expand/collapse and search
- [x] Category filtering in sidebar
- [x] Pagination with infinite scroll
- [ ] Advanced search with filters (price range, author)
- [ ] "Blueprints like this" recommendations
- [ ] Trending blueprints section

#### Template Analytics

- [ ] Track template downloads/usage (ClickHouse)
- [ ] Show trending templates
- [ ] Usage statistics for template authors
- [ ] Revenue reports for paid templates

## 💰 Monetization Strategy

### Subscription Tiers

| Tier      | Monthly        | Annual (10% off) | Features                                                       |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free**  | €0/month       | €0/year          | Basic templates, limited wizard features                       |
| **Pro**   | €5/month       | €54/year         | Intermediate repo wizards, priority support                    |
| **Max**   | €20/month      | €216/year        | Advanced wizards + ALL community prompts (including paid ones) |
| **Teams** | €30/seat/month | €324/seat/year   | Everything in Max + team features, SSO, centralized billing    |

#### Key Subscription Rules

- **Users (free)**: Full wizard access, all platforms, API, sell blueprints
- **Teams**: Everything in Users + AI features, SSO, team-shared blueprints

#### Billing Intervals

- **Monthly**: Can be canceled anytime. Access continues until end of billing period.
- **Annual**: 10% discount. Cannot be canceled mid-cycle (yearly commitment). Access continues until year ends.

### Teams Tier Details ✅ IMPLEMENTED

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Price | €30/seat/month |
| Minimum seats | 3 |
| Maximum seats | Unlimited |
| Color | Teal/Cyan gradient |
| AI usage limit | €15/user/month |

#### Teams Features

- **Team-shared blueprints**: Share blueprints privately within your team
- **Blueprint visibility**: Private, Team, or Public options
- **SSO authentication**: SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, LDAP/Active Directory
- **Centralized billing**: One admin pays for all seats
- **Active user billing**: Only pay for users who logged in during the billing period
- **Roles**: ADMIN (full control) and MEMBER (team access)
- **Multiple admins**: Teams can have multiple administrators
- **Pro-rated billing**: Adding seats mid-cycle charges prorated amount
- **Credits**: Unused seats generate credits for next cycle

#### Teams Billing Logic

```
Monthly Bill = €30 × MAX(active_users, 3)

Where:
- active_users = users who logged in during the billing period
- Minimum 3 seats always billed (even if only 2 active)
- Mid-cycle additions: (€30 / 30 days) × days_remaining × new_seats
- Credits: (billed_seats - active_seats) × €30 → next cycle
```

### Template Marketplace Pricing

#### Individual Template Purchases

- **Minimum price**: €5 (configurable by author, minimum €5)
- **Default suggested price**: €5
- **Author sets their own price** above minimum

#### Revenue Split

| Recipient                 | Standard | With Max Discount |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| **Template Author**       | 70%      |
| **Platform (LynxPrompt)** | 30%      |

### Revenue Split Model

All blueprint purchases follow a simple 70/30 split:
- Authors receive 70% of the sale price
- Platform retains 30% as a fee
- No discounts - everyone pays the same price

#### Example

```
Blueprint Price: €10
Author receives: €7.00
Platform receives: €3.00
```

### Payment Processing

**Primary**: Stripe (cards + subscriptions)
- Best developer experience, excellent recurring billing
- EU-friendly with SEPA support
- Good webhook system for subscription lifecycle
- Customer portal for self-service billing management

**Payouts to Authors**: PayPal (min €5, monthly or on-demand)
- Wide acceptance among creators
- Alternative: Stripe Connect (future consideration for direct bank transfers)

### Currency Strategy

**Base Currency**: EUR (Euros)

**Why EUR, not multi-currency:**

1. **Legal/Tax simplicity**: Spain-based autónomo — EUR makes VAT, invoicing, and accounting straightforward
2. **Stripe handles conversion**: Users see their local currency at checkout (USD, GBP, etc.) — Stripe converts automatically
3. **Single source of truth**: One price list, no exchange rate maintenance, no arbitrage issues
4. **Stable global currency**: EUR is widely recognized; many SaaS (Notion, Linear) price in single currency

**Current behavior:**
- Pricing page shows EUR (€5, €20)
- Stripe Checkout displays converted amount in user's card currency before payment
- User's card is charged in their local currency (e.g., USD for US users)

**Planned enhancement (UX improvement, not critical — far future):**
- [ ] **Approximate local prices on pricing page**: Detect user's locale via browser
  - Show: "€20/month (~$22 USD)" for US visitors
  - Sets expectations before checkout without committing to a second price point

**Implementation approach (Option A - static rates + browser locale):**
```typescript
// lib/currency.ts
const EUR_RATES: Record<string, { rate: number; symbol: string }> = {
  USD: { rate: 1.10, symbol: '$' },
  GBP: { rate: 0.85, symbol: '£' },
  CAD: { rate: 1.50, symbol: 'CA$' },
  AUD: { rate: 1.65, symbol: 'A$' },
};

const LOCALE_TO_CURRENCY: Record<string, string> = {
  'en-US': 'USD', 'en-GB': 'GBP', 'en-CA': 'CAD', 'en-AU': 'AUD',
};

export function getApproxPrice(eurAmount: number): string | null {
  const currency = LOCALE_TO_CURRENCY[navigator.language];
  if (!currency) return null;
  const { rate, symbol } = EUR_RATES[currency];
  return `~${symbol}${Math.round(eurAmount * rate)}`;
}
```
- No API calls, no costs, privacy-friendly
- Update rates manually once a month (approximations don't need precision)

**Not planned (avoided complexity):**
- ❌ Dual USD/EUR pricing (requires two Stripe products, rate sync, potential confusion)
- ❌ Dynamic pricing based on location (legal/tax complexity, user trust issues)
- ❌ Multiple currency products in Stripe (maintenance burden for small team)

- [ ] Moderation queue for new template submissions
- [ ] Bulk approve/reject actions
- [ ] Email verification requirement for paid submissions
- [ ] Content policy enforcement
- [ ] Revenue and payout management

### Abuse Prevention

- [ ] Rate limiting (max 5 templates per user per day)
- [ ] User reputation system (first 3 templates require approval)
- [ ] Content filtering (spam patterns, profanity, suspicious URLs)
- [ ] Report button for users to flag bad templates
- [ ] CAPTCHA on submission form
- [ ] Fraud detection for payments
- [ ] Chargeback handling

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure

- [ ] Redis for caching/sessions
- [ ] S3/R2 for file storage (template assets, user uploads)
- [x] GlitchTip error tracking (self-hosted at glitchtip.lynxprompt.com)
- [x] Status page (Uptime Kuma) at status.lynxprompt.com
- [ ] CDN for static assets
- [ ] Database backups automation
- [x] Payment webhook handlers (Stripe)

### Current Infrastructure

- [x] PostgreSQL (4 databases: app, users, blog, support)
- [x] ClickHouse (self-hosted EU, analytics)
- [x] Umami (self-hosted EU, cookieless analytics)
- [x] Docker deployment with GitOps (Portainer)
- [x] Cloudflare DDoS protection and WAF
- [x] TLS 1.3 encryption in transit
- [x] Network isolation (databases not exposed to internet)

### Security Enhancements (Planned)

- [ ] **PostgreSQL column-level encryption (pgcrypto)**
  - Encrypt sensitive columns (passkey credentials, OAuth tokens, etc.)
  - Implementation: Enable pgcrypto extension, encrypt/decrypt in Prisma queries
  - Priority: Medium (data is already protected by network isolation)
- [ ] Filesystem-level encryption for database volumes (Unraid encrypted share)
- [ ] Annual third-party penetration test
- [ ] Bug bounty program (HackerOne or similar)

> **Note:** GlitchTip is preferred over Sentry for self-hosted error tracking. It integrates well with our existing ClickHouse setup and keeps all data in EU.

---

## 📋 Technical Debt

- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
- [ ] Set up E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Performance optimization (bundle size, lazy loading)
- [ ] Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- [ ] SEO optimization (meta tags, structured data)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements
- [ ] Dark mode refinements
- [ ] Fix unused import warnings
- [ ] **Remove `--legacy-peer-deps` from npm install**: Currently required because `@sentry/nextjs` doesn't support Next.js 16 yet (peer dependency conflict). Once Sentry releases a version supporting Next.js 16, update `@sentry/nextjs` and remove `--legacy-peer-deps` from both local install commands and the Dockerfile

---

## 🚀 Launch & Marketing

### Beta Launch Strategy

- [ ] **Reddit beta testers campaign**: 100 free 1-year subscriptions for first 100 users
  - In exchange for: populating database, feedback, spreading the word
  - Goal: Beta testers, platform refinement, initial content

### Brand Positioning

- [x] **IDE-agnostic prompt rules**: Market as universal AI configuration, not IDE-specific
- [x] **"AI Config Site"**: Position as more than a marketplace - a comprehensive AI configuration platform
- [x] **Memory project compatibility**: Emphasize that this bootstraps new repos/codebases, reducing need for memory systems
- [x] **IDE logo stripe**: Like agents.md, show all compatible IDEs (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, Windsurf, Zed, etc.) with their logos

### Visual Assets

- [ ] **Logo in OAuth providers**: When logo is ready, add it to GitHub/Google login screens
- [x] **IDE compatibility section**: Add to main page AND docs - visual stripe of all supported IDEs with logos
- [ ] **Explainer video**: Create a ~1 minute video explaining the concept of LynxPrompt and how it works

### Stripe Production Release

To go live with Stripe payments:

1. **Complete Stripe account verification**:
   - Verify identity (ID upload)
   - Verify business (if applicable)
   - Add bank account for payouts

2. **Switch API keys**:
   - Replace `sk_test_xxx` with `sk_live_xxx` in production
   - Replace `whsec_test_xxx` with production webhook secret
   - Update price IDs to production price IDs

3. **Configure webhook endpoint**:
   - In Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → Add endpoint
   - URL: `https://lynxprompt.com/api/billing/webhook`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.*`, `invoice.*`

4. **Test with real card** (small amounts) before announcing

## 📝 UX Improvements

### Onboarding

- [x] **Persona selection (optional)**: Clarify that persona is for dynamic template personalization
  - Make it optional, not mandatory (added "Skip for now" button)
  - User may not want to share info
  - Also ask for display name/nickname (not real name required)
  - Explain: "Your persona (e.g., DevOps Engineer) is added to downloaded templates for personalization"

### Dashboard

- [x] **Share prompt suggestion**: Suggest users share their prompts to earn money
  - Include prompts created with wizard
  - "Turn your prompts into passive income" CTA

### Blueprint Upload

- [x] **Revenue split visibility**: Show 70% author / 30% platform ONLY when user selects "Set Price" option
  - Don't show in pricing page or elsewhere
  - Show inline when configuring paid template

- [x] **Sensitive data detection**: Warn users before upload if passwords/API keys detected
  - Scan for: passwords, API keys, tokens, secrets, private keys
  - Show warning modal: "We detected potential sensitive data. Please review before sharing."
  - Highlight detected patterns
  - Require confirmation to proceed

- [x] **Auto-update option**: Ask in wizard if blueprint should include auto-update instruction
  - Add instruction to blueprint: "Track user coding patterns and update this file accordingly"
  - AI agents will then self-improve the config based on user behavior
  - Question in wizard: "Should this blueprint include self-improvement instructions?"

### User Preferences

- [ ] **License preferences**: Store preferred licenses per user
  - Ask license preference per-repo during wizard
  - Remember what was used before for next repos
  - User can set default license in dashboard settings
  - Edit licenses separately from templates in dashboard

- [ ] **FUNDING.yml configuration**: 
  - Only ask if GitHub repository is selected in wizard
  - Remember choice for subsequent prompts using GitHub
  - Ask user if they want to reuse previous FUNDING.yml
  - Store in user preferences (dashboard > Preferences > Static Files)
  - User can manage/edit these static files in dashboard

- [ ] **Static files management (Dashboard)**:
  - LICENSE: View/edit saved license files
  - FUNDING.yml: View/edit funding configuration
  - Other reusable files that persist across projects

---

## 🔗 IDE Deep Linking (Research)

Enable "click to install" functionality where downloading a blueprint automatically opens it in the user's IDE.

### Supported URL Schemes

| IDE | URL Scheme | Example |
|-----|------------|---------|
| **VS Code** | `vscode://file/{path}` | `vscode://file/c:/project/AGENTS.md` |
| **Cursor** | `cursor://file/{path}` | `cursor://file//path/to/file:line` |
| **JetBrains** | `jetbrains://<ide>/navigate/reference?project=X&path=Y:line` | `jetbrains://idea/navigate/...` |
| **Windsurf** | `windsurf:///{path}:line` | `windsurf:///path/to/file.txt:10` |

### Implementation Plan

- [ ] **Detect user's IDE** - Ask during profile setup or auto-detect
- [ ] **Generate deep link URLs** - Based on selected platform
- [ ] **"Open in IDE" button** - Next to download button on blueprint pages
- [ ] **Browser permission** - User must allow opening external apps
- [ ] **Fallback** - Regular download if deep link fails

### Limitations

- User must have IDE installed and registered as URL handler
- Path must be known (user selects project folder or we use temp location)
- Cross-platform complexity (paths differ on Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Security: Users must trust the link source

### Alternative: CLI Tool

```bash
npx lynxprompt wizard  # Generate AI IDE config in current directory
```

---

## 🖥️ CLI Tooling

### Overview

A command-line interface for LynxPrompt that allows developers to initialize and manage AI IDE configurations directly from their terminal. The CLI will use the existing API v1 infrastructure.

**Design Principle**: The CLI must have **feature parity with the web wizard**. Every configuration option available in the wizard should be available via CLI flags or interactive prompts.

### Distribution Strategy

| Platform | Package Manager | Package Name | Priority |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Cross-platform** | npm/npx | `lynxprompt` | ✅ Phase 1 |
| **macOS** | Homebrew | `brew install lynxprompt/tap/lynxprompt` | 📦 Phase 2 |
| **Windows** | Chocolatey | `choco install lynxprompt` | 📦 Phase 2 |
| **Linux** | Snap Store | `snap install lynxprompt` | 📦 Phase 2 |

> **Note**: Snap is preferred over apt for Linux as it doesn't require managing a PPA repository and provides automatic updates.

### Interactive Wizard (Primary Experience)

The CLI is **interactive-first**. Just run `lynxprompt wizard` and it walks you through everything:

```
$ lynxprompt wizard

🐱 Welcome to LynxPrompt!

? What's your project name? my-api
? Describe your project in one sentence: REST API for user management

? Select your tech stack: (use arrows, space to select)
  ◉ TypeScript
  ◉ Node.js
  ◉ Express
  ◯ Python
  ◯ Go

? Which AI IDEs do you use? (select all that apply)
  ◉ Cursor (.cursor/rules/)
  ◉ Claude Code (CLAUDE.md)
  ◉ GitHub Copilot
  ◯ Windsurf
  ◯ Zed

? What's the AI's persona/role?
  ❯ Backend Developer - APIs, databases, microservices
    Full-Stack Developer - Complete application setups
    DevOps Engineer - Infrastructure, CI/CD, containers
    Custom...

? Auto-detected commands from package.json:
  Build: npm run build ✓
  Test:  npm test ✓
  Lint:  npm run lint ✓
  Dev:   npm run dev ✓
  ? Edit these? (y/N)

? Select boundary preset:
  ❯ Conservative - Ask before most changes
    Standard - Balance of freedom and safety
    Permissive - AI can modify freely within src/

? Want to use an agent preset instead?
  ◯ Start fresh (custom config)
  ◯ @test-agent - Writes tests
  ◯ @docs-agent - Generates documentation
  ◯ @lint-agent - Fixes code style
  ◯ @api-agent - Builds API endpoints

✅ Generated files:
   .cursor/rules/project.mdc
   CLAUDE.md
   .github/copilot-instructions.md

? Save as blueprint to LynxPrompt? (y/N)
```

No flags to remember. The wizard guides you through every step, just like the web UI.

### CLI Commands

The CLI is available as both `lynxprompt` and the short alias `lynxp`.

```bash
# Interactive wizard for generating configurations (recommended)
lynxp wizard

# Pull an existing blueprint
lynxp pull bp_abc123

# List your blueprints
lynxp list

# Search public blueprints
lynxp search "nextjs typescript"

# Auto-detect project and suggest config
lynxp analyze

# Login (opens browser)
lynxp login

# Show current config status
lynxp status

# Push local changes to LynxPrompt
lynxp push
```

### Non-Interactive Mode (for CI/CD)

Flags are available for scripting and automation:

```bash
# Skip prompts with flags (for CI/CD pipelines)
lynxprompt wizard \
  --name "my-api" \
  --stack typescript,express \
  --format cursor,claude \
  --persona backend \
  --boundaries conservative \
  --yes

# Pull and apply without prompts
lynxprompt pull bp_abc123 --yes
```

### Feature Parity: Web ↔ CLI

Every wizard step works in both interactive and flag modes:

| Wizard Step | Interactive | Flag (for automation) |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Project Info | ✅ Text prompts | `--name`, `--description` |
| Tech Stack | ✅ Multi-select | `--stack` |
| Platforms | ✅ Checkboxes | `--platforms` |
| Repository | ✅ Prompts | `--repo`, `--license` |
| Release Strategy | ✅ Selection | `--versioning` |
| CI/CD | ✅ Prompts | `--ci` |
| **Persona** | ✅ Selection | `--persona` |
| **Commands** | ✅ Auto-detect + edit | `--commands` |
| **Code Style** | ✅ Preset selection | `--style` |
| **Boundaries** | ✅ Preset picker | `--boundaries` |
| Agent Presets | ✅ Selection | `--preset` |

### Authentication Flow (`lynxprompt login`)

```
$ lynxprompt login

🔐 Opening browser to authenticate...
   https://lynxprompt.com/auth/cli?session=abc123

Waiting for authentication... ✓

✅ Logged in as sergio@example.com
   Token stored securely in system keychain
   Expires: Never (or in 1 year if you prefer)

You're ready to use LynxPrompt CLI!
```

**How it works:**

1. CLI generates a unique session ID
2. Opens browser to `lynxprompt.com/auth/cli?session=xxx`
3. User authenticates via GitHub/Google/Magic Link (existing auth)
4. Server **automatically creates a CLI API token** with `write` permissions
5. Server sends token back to CLI via callback/polling
6. CLI stores token in OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
7. Token is used for all future API calls

**Server-side changes needed:**

- [ ] New endpoint: `POST /api/auth/cli/session` - Create CLI session
- [ ] New endpoint: `GET /api/auth/cli/poll` - Check if auth completed
- [ ] New endpoint: `POST /api/auth/cli/callback` - Complete auth, create token
- [ ] Auto-generate API token with name "LynxPrompt CLI" and `write` permission
- [ ] Token has long expiry (1 year) or no expiry for CLI convenience

**Other auth commands:**

```bash
# Check current login status
lynxprompt whoami
# Output: Logged in as sergio@example.com (Pro plan)

# Log out and remove stored token
lynxprompt logout
# Output: ✓ Logged out and removed stored credentials

# Use a specific token (for CI/CD)
LYNXPROMPT_TOKEN=lp_xxx lynxprompt list
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: npm Package (Priority)
- [ ] Create `@lynxprompt/cli` package
- [ ] Implement `lynxprompt login` - OAuth flow with automatic token creation
- [ ] Implement `lynxprompt whoami` - Show current user and plan
- [ ] Implement `lynxprompt logout` - Remove stored credentials
- [ ] Implement `lynxprompt wizard` - Interactive wizard matching web UI
- [ ] Implement `lynxprompt list` - List user's blueprints via API
- [ ] Implement `lynxprompt pull` - Download blueprint to current directory
- [ ] Store API token securely in OS keychain (keytar)
- [ ] Support `LYNXPROMPT_TOKEN` env var for CI/CD
- [ ] Support `.lynxpromptrc` config file for project settings
- [ ] Publish to npm registry

#### Phase 1.5: Wizard Parity
- [ ] `--persona` flag with all persona options from web wizard
- [ ] `--commands` flag with auto-detection from package.json/Makefile/etc.
- [ ] `--boundaries` flag with preset levels (conservative/standard/permissive)
- [ ] `--preset` flag for agent presets (test-agent, docs-agent, etc.)
- [ ] `--style` flag for code style presets
- [ ] `lynxprompt detect` - Analyze current directory and suggest config

#### Phase 2: Platform-Specific Packages
- [ ] **Homebrew tap**: Create `homebrew-tap` repository with formula
- [ ] **Chocolatey**: Create package manifest and publish to community repo
- [ ] **Snap**: Create `snapcraft.yaml` and publish to Snap Store

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] `lynxprompt push` - Upload local configs as new blueprint
- [ ] `lynxprompt diff` - Show changes between local and remote
- [ ] CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions action)
- [ ] `lynxprompt validate` - Validate config against best practices

### Auto-Detection (`lynxprompt detect`)

The CLI should analyze the current directory and auto-detect:

```bash
$ lynxprompt detect

Detected project configuration:
  Tech Stack: TypeScript, Next.js 15, Prisma, Tailwind CSS
  Package Manager: npm
  Commands:
    Build: npm run build
    Test: npm test  
    Lint: npm run lint
    Dev: npm run dev
  File Structure:
    Source: src/
    Tests: tests/
    Docs: docs/
  
Suggested boundaries:
  ✅ Always: src/, tests/, docs/
  ⚠️ Ask first: prisma/schema.prisma, package.json
  🚫 Never: node_modules/, .env, .git/

Generate config with these settings? [Y/n]
```

### Technical Requirements

- **Language**: TypeScript (compile to single binary with `pkg` or `bun build`)
- **Authentication**: Reuse existing API v1 token system
- **Config storage**: `~/.config/lynxprompt/config.json`
- **Credentials**: OS keychain via `keytar` (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
- **Interactive UI**: Use `inquirer` or `prompts` for interactive mode
- **Auto-detection**: Parse `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, etc.

## 🧠 CLI Philosophy & Strategic Analysis

> **Last updated**: December 2024

This section documents the strategic thinking behind CLI design decisions, user personas, and the balance between simplicity and power.

### Deprecated Formats

> ❌ **`.cursorrules` is DEPRECATED**. Cursor now uses `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (directory-based MDC format with YAML frontmatter). Never suggest or generate `.cursorrules` in any documentation, wizard, or CLI output.

### AI Code Editor Format Analysis

After analyzing 25+ AI coding assistants, here's how they handle configuration:

| Format | Editors | Structure |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Single Markdown File** | AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, Copilot, Zed, Gemini, Warp, Aider, Crush | One file at root or in directory |
| **Directory-based (MDC)** | Cursor (.cursor/rules/), Amazon Q, Augment Code, Kilocode, Kiro, Trae AI, Firebase Studio, Roo Code | Multiple files with YAML frontmatter |
| **Plain Text** | Windsurf (.windsurfrules), Cline (.clinerules), Goose (.goosehints) | Simple text files |
| **JSON Config** | MCP agents, Firebender, OpenCode | Structured JSON |

**Key insight**: Most editors use **single markdown files**. Directory-based formats (like Cursor's) are the exception, not the rule. A single file can work everywhere.

### Single File vs Multi-File: The Decision

**Question**: Do we need `.lynxprompt/rules/` with multiple files, or can everything be a single file?

**Answer**: **Single file is sufficient for 90% of users.** The directory structure adds complexity that most users don't need.

**When single file works**:
- Solo developers
- Small teams
- Projects using 1-2 AI editors
- Users who want simplicity

**When multi-file (`.lynxprompt/`) makes sense**:
- Power users managing multiple AI editors from one source
- Enterprise teams with complex rule structures
- Projects with many specialized rules (testing, security, docs, etc.)

**Decision**: Default to direct file generation (AGENTS.md, .cursor/rules/). Offer `.lynxprompt/` as an advanced option.

### User Persona Analysis

Understanding who uses LynxPrompt and what they actually need:

#### Persona 1: Solo Dev Starting First Repo

```
Goal: Get AI assistant working quickly (5 minutes or less)
Journey:
  1. Discovers LynxPrompt
  2. Runs wizard (web or CLI)
  3. Answers 5 questions
  4. Gets AGENTS.md or .cursor/rules/
  5. Done. Moves on with life.
  
Needs:
  ✅ Quick wizard, minimal questions
  ✅ Direct file output (no abstraction)
  ✅ Works without login/account
  ❌ Doesn't need: folder structures, cloud features
```

#### Persona 2: Developer on Large Open Source Project

```
Goal: Consistent AI rules for all contributors
Journey:
  1. Maintainer creates AGENTS.md via wizard
  2. Commits to repo
  3. All contributors get it via git
  4. Updates go through normal PR process
  
Needs:
  ✅ Version controlled rules (git handles this)
  ✅ No vendor lock-in (plain markdown files)
  ✅ Works offline, no cloud dependency
  ❌ Doesn't need: team tier (git is their sync)
```

#### Persona 3: Small Team (3-5 devs)

```
Goal: Share rules across team without manual copy-paste
Journey:
  A) Git-based: Lead creates config, commits, team pulls via git
  B) Cloud-based: Uses LynxPrompt Teams for sharing
  
Needs:
  ✅ Easy way to share (git or cloud)
  ✅ Consistency across team
  ⚠️ Maybe needs: .lynxprompt/ for multi-editor teams
```

#### Persona 4: Enterprise Team

```
Goal: Standardized AI rules across organization, compliance
Journey:
  1. Platform team creates approved rules
  2. Distributes via internal registry OR LynxPrompt Teams
  3. Enforces via CI/CD validation
  
Needs:
  ✅ Centralized management
  ✅ Audit trail, SSO
  ✅ On-prem option (just commit files to internal repo)
  ✅ CI/CD validation (lynxp check)
```

#### Persona 5: Lazy Wizard User

```
Goal: Minimum effort, working config
Journey:
  1. Goes to lynxprompt.com
  2. Clicks through wizard (5 clicks)
  3. Downloads ZIP
  4. Extracts to project
  5. Done!
  
Needs:
  ✅ Web wizard (no CLI install needed)
  ✅ One-click defaults
  ✅ ZIP download
  ❌ Never installs CLI, never uses advanced features
```

### Cloud vs Local Strategy

**Research**: How successful companies handle this:

| Company | Model |
|---------|-------|
| **GitHub** | Free local git, paid for teams/enterprise features |
| **Vercel** | Free deploys, paid for teams |
| **Notion** | Free personal, paid for teams |
| **Nextcloud** | Self-hosted + cloud options |

**Pattern**: Core functionality works locally/free. Cloud adds team features, sync, convenience.

**LynxPrompt Decision**:

| Feature | Free/Local | Paid/Cloud |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Wizard (web + CLI) | ✅ | ✅ |
| File generation | ✅ | ✅ |
| Works offline | ✅ | - |
| Marketplace blueprints | - | ✅ |
| Team sharing | - | ✅ |
| Team sharing | - | ✅ |
| Version history | - | ✅ |

**Key principle**: **Never force cloud.** The CLI and web wizard must work 100% offline. Cloud features are optional enhancements.

### The `.lynxprompt/` Folder Question

**Current structure**:
```
.lynxprompt/
├── conf.yml       # Config (exporters, sources)
├── rules/         # Rules files
│   └── agents.md
└── README.md
```

**When it adds value**:
- User has multiple AI editors (Cursor + Claude + Copilot)
- Wants single source of truth → export to all
- Power users who want fine-grained control

**When it's overhead**:
- Solo dev using just Cursor
- User just wants quick config
- Anyone who wants quick config

**Decision**: Two CLI workflows:

```bash
# Simple (default for most users):
lynxp wizard → generates AGENTS.md directly
# Done. No .lynxprompt/ folder needed.

# Advanced (power users):
lynxp wizard --format agents,cursor,claude → generates all formats
```

### Why We Don't Need Separate "Presets"

**Question**: Should we have pre-made presets like "nextjs-app-router", "typescript-strict"?

**Answer**: **No, because we already have two mechanisms for this:**

1. **The Wizard** - Generates custom configs based on user choices (stack, persona, boundaries). This IS the "preset generator".

2. **Marketplace Blueprints** - Pre-made configs shared by the community. Users can `lynxp pull <blueprint>` to get a complete config.

**Presets would duplicate both** without adding value. Instead, we should:
- Make the wizard smarter (better defaults, project detection)
- Make blueprints easier to discover and apply
- NOT create a third category of "presets"

### Recommended Default Workflow

Based on persona analysis, the default should be:

```bash
$ lynxp wizard

🐱 Welcome to LynxPrompt!

Detected: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Prisma
Suggested: AGENTS.md (works with most AI editors)

? Accept defaults? (Y/n) Y

✅ Generated: AGENTS.md

Your AI assistants will now follow these rules.
Tip: Run 'lynxp wizard' again anytime to regenerate.
```

**Principles**:
1. **One command, useful output** - `lynxp wizard` should produce something immediately useful
2. **Smart defaults** - Auto-detect project, suggest most compatible format
3. **No abstraction by default** - Direct file generation, no `.lynxprompt/` unless requested
4. **Cloud is optional** - Everything works offline

### CI/CD Integration

For teams that want to validate rules in CI:

```bash
# Add to CI pipeline
lynxp check --ci

# Validates:
# - Config file syntax (if using .lynxprompt/)
# - Rules directory exists (if using .lynxprompt/)
# - No syntax errors in markdown
# - Exit code: 0 = pass, 1 = fail
```

### External Source Support (Future)

Allow importing rules from GitHub URLs (for teams who want to share rules across repos):

```yaml
# .lynxprompt/conf.yml (advanced mode only)
sources:
  - type: local
    path: .lynxprompt/rules
  - type: git
    url: https://github.com/company/shared-rules
    path: rules/base.md
```

This enables:
- Company-wide rules in a shared repo
- Community rule collections
- Team rules without LynxPrompt cloud

---

## 💡 Future Ideas

### High Priority
- **Template Wizards**: Custom wizard templates that users can create and share
  - Define wizard steps, questions, and logic in YAML/JSON format
  - Share wizard templates via web and CLI (`lynxp wizard --template my-template`)
  - Wizard marketplace alongside blueprint marketplace
  - Companies can create onboarding wizards for their tech stack
  - Web UI for creating wizard templates (drag-and-drop step builder)
- **GitHub URL Import**: Share a public GitHub repository URL in the wizard and auto-prefill all settings based on the repo's structure (needs AI analysis of package.json, language detection, framework detection, etc.)
- **AI-powered recommendations**: Suggest blueprints based on project structure analysis
- **Template quality scoring**: Automated scoring based on completeness, community ratings, usage
- **Blueprint analytics dashboard**: Detailed stats for authors (downloads over time, geography, referrers)

### Medium Priority
- **Blueprint upload timestamp display**: Show when a blueprint was uploaded on the public blueprint page (e.g., `/blueprints/usr_xxx`). Display date and time for users to see how recent the content is.
- VS Code extension for templates
- GitHub App for automatic config updates
- Template marketplace revenue sharing analytics
- Webhook integrations (notify when template is downloaded)
- Template collections/bundles
- "Compare templates" feature side-by-side
- Affiliate program for promoters
- Gift subscriptions
- DMCA/copyright complaints process
- Bank transfer payouts (via Stripe Connect)

### Low Priority / Long-term
- **Local app integration**: IDE receives configs directly from web (Electron/Tauri)
- Multi-language support (i18n) - only when user base justifies
- **Cryptocurrency payments (Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC) via Coinbase Commerce**
- Custom integrations (Slack, Teams notifications)
- White-label solutions for enterprise

### Completed Ideas ✅
- ~~Annual subscription discount~~ → 10% discount (~1.2 months free)
- ~~Use gravatar for emails~~ → Implemented
- ~~Team/organization features~~ → Teams tier launched
- ~~Private templates for teams~~ → Team visibility option
- ~~Template changelogs~~ → Version history with changelogs
- ~~CLI tool~~ → Now in active development (see CLI Tooling section)
